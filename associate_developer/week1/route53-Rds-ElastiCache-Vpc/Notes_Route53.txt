Route 53:
    Managed DNS ( domain name system)
    Collection of rules and record which helps clients understand how to reach a server through urls

    Common Record in AWS are:
        A: URL to IPv4
        AAAA: URL to IPv6
        CNAME:  URL to URL
        Alias: URL to AWS Resource

 A Record example:
    WebBrowser > requests http://myapp.myDomain.com  > ROUTE 53
    ROUTE53 > (knows the ipv4 of that URL) sends back ip say 32.55.97.85 > WebBrowser
    WebBrowser httpReq-> <-httpRes Application Server (IPv4 32.55.97.85)

Route53 works with both public domain, and private domain (VPCs)
