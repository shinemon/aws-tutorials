EC2
    Elastic Cloud Compute
    Infrastructure as a Service

Renting virtual machines (EC2)
Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
Distributing load across machines (ELB)
Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)


EC2 on demand, spot request, dedicated host



EC2 Placement Groups
    control over ec2 instance  placement strategy

    Cluster - cluster instances into a low latency group in a single Availability Zone [High availability, but High Risk]
    Spread - spreads instances across underlying hardware (mx 7 per group per AZ) - critical applications
    Partition - spreads instances across many different partition (rely on different set of racks) within an AZ.
                scales 100s of ec2 instances per group (kafka, hadoop, casandra)


EBS
    Elastic Block store is like a network drive (not attached physical drive) which you can attach to your instance while they run

it allows to persist data even after termination


AMI
    amazon machine image
    ami are customization of ec2 instance


EC2 Instance Store
    EBS volumes are network drives with good but 'limited' performance.
    Hence if we need high performance hardware disk, use ec2InstanceStore
    its better i/o, good throughput

    caveat: if we terminate/stop  the ec2 instance then the storage is lost.
    Good for buffer, cache, temporary data etc.
