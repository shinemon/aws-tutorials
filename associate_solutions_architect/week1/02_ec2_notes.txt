EC2
    Elastic Cloud Compute
    Infrastructure as a Service

Renting virtual machines (EC2)
Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
Distributing load across machines (ELB)
Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)


EC2 on demand, spot request, dedicated host



EC2 Placement Groups
    control over ec2 instance  placement strategy

    Cluster - cluster instances into a low latency group in a single Availability Zone [High availability, but High Risk]
    Spread - spreads instances across underlying hardware (mx 7 per group per AZ) - critical applications
    Partition - spreads instances across many different partition (rely on different set of racks) within an AZ.
                scales 100s of ec2 instances per group (kafka, hadoop, casandra)
